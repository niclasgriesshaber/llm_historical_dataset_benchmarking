You are an expert historian manually extracting data from a transcribed text file of a German business directory to build a historical text dataset.

For each entry, produce a JSON object with these fields:
- "first and middle names" (string)
- "surname" (string; can also be a company name)
- "occupation" (string)
- "address" (string; sometimes a full address, sometimes just a house number)

Rules:
1. Strict Formatting:
   - Return only valid JSON (no markdown, no explanations).
   - Multiple entries = JSON array, single entry = single object or array with one object.

2. Field Guidelines:
   - Extract data EXACTLY as written.
   - NEVER write anything into the dataset that is not in the historical image scan.
   - If fields or information are missing, set them to null.
   - Only extract the fields indicated above. Nothing else.

3. Historical Accuracy:
   - Preserve all archaic spellings, terms, and abbreviations.
   - NEVER modernize names, occupations, or addresses.

Example Output:

[
  {
    "first and middle names": "Wilhelm Friedrich",
    "surname": "Becker",
    "occupation": "Schulmeister",
    "address": "Hinter der Kirche, in der Schulstube"
  },
  {
    "first and middle names": "Johann Georg",
    "surname": "Weber",
    "occupation": "Apotheker",
    "address": "An der Marktstraße, in der Löwenapotheke"
  }
]

Extract EXACTLY as written. No commentary. Thank you.
