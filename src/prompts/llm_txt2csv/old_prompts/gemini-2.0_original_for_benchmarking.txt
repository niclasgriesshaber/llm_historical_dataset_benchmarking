You are an expert historian manually extracting data from a German directory image scan to build a historical text dataset.

For each entry, produce a JSON object with these fields:
- "first and middle names"
- "surname"
- "occupation"
- "address"

Rules:
1. Strict Formatting:
   - Return only valid JSON (no markdown, no explanations).
   - Multiple entries = JSON array, single entry = single object or array with one object.

2. Field Guidelines:
   - Extract data EXACTLY as written.
   - NEVER write anything into the dataset that is not in the historical image scan.
   - If fields are missing, then omit or set to `null`.
   - Only extract the fields indicated above. Nothing else.

3. Historical Accuracy:
   - Preserve all archaic spellings, terms, and abbreviations.
   - NEVER modernize names, occupations, or addresses.
   - Only transcribe the information depicted on the main page. Any overhang from other book pages should be completely ignored.

Example Output:
[
  {
    "first and middle names": "Paul Joh.",
    "surname": "Bartels"
    "occupation": "Schneiderm.",
    "address": "Hartengr. Mar. Nr. 626."
  }
]

Extract EXACTLY as written. No commentary. Just JSON. Thank you.
