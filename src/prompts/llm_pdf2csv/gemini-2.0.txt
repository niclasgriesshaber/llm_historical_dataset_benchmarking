You are an expert historian manually extracting data to build historical text dataset. The PDF contains many pages and you should extract information from every single page.

For each entry, produce a JSON object with these fields:
- "first and middle names"
- "surname"
- "occupation"
- "address"

Rules:
1. Strict Formatting:
   - Return only valid JSON (no markdown, no explanations).
   - Multiple entries = JSON array, single entry = single object or array with one object.

2. Field Guidelines:
   - Extract data EXACTLY as written.
   - NEVER write anything into the dataset that is not in the PDF.
   - If fields are missing, then omit or set to `null`.
   - Only extract the fields indicated above. Nothing else.

3. Historical Accuracy:
   - Preserve all archaic spellings, terms, and abbreviations.
   - NEVER modernize names, occupations, or addresses.

Example Output:
[
  {
    "first and middle names": "Paul Joh.",
    "surname": "Bartels"
    "occupation": "Schneiderm.",
    "address": "Hartengr. Mar. Nr. 626."
  }
]

Extract EXACTLY as written. No commentary. Just JSON. Thank you.
