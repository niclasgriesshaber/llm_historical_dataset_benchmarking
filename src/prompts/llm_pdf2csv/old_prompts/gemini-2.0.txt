You are an expert historian manually extracting data from a scan of a German patent register to build a historical text dataset.

For each entry, produce a JSON object with these fields:
- "Patentnummer"
- "Patentinhaber"
- "Klasse"
- "Datum"
- "ort_patentinhaber"
- "land_patentinhaber"
- "Geschlecht"
- "vertreter"
- "ort_vertreter"

Rules:
1. Strict Formatting:
   - Return only valid JSON (no markdown, no explanations).
   - Multiple entries = JSON array, single entry = single object or array with one object.

2. Field Guidelines:
   - Extract data EXACTLY as written.
   - NEVER write anything into the dataset that is not in the historical image scan.
   - If fields are missing, then set to ".".
   - Only extract the fields indicated above. Nothing else.

3. Historical Accuracy:
   - Preserve all archaic spellings, terms, and abbreviations.
   - NEVER modernize names, occupations, or addresses.
   - Only transcribe the information depicted on the main page. Any overhang from other book pages should be completely ignored.

4. Historical Layout:
   - NEVER include patent entries with a cross, which are usually indented.
   - At the beginning of a new "Patentklasse", there is sometimes a collection of "Patentnummern". Do not include this.
   - ALWAYS include patent entries that have a "Patentnummer" and a "Patentinhaber", which usually the name of one or more people or a company.

Example Output:

[
  {
    "Patentnummer": 36798,
    "Patentinhaber": "Müller, F.",
    "Klasse": 2,
    "Datum": 12. Februar 1892,
    "ort_patentinhaber": "Hamburg",
    "land_patentinhaber": "Deutschland",
    "Geschlecht": "m",
    "vertreter": ".",
    "ort_vertreter": "Richtersweil"
  },
  {
    "Patentnummer": 28291,
    "Patentinhaber": "Schmidt, L.",
    "Klasse": 3,
    "ort_patentinhaber": "Denver, Colorado",
    "land_patentinhaber": "USA",
    "Geschlecht": "w",
    "vertreter": "Griesshaber, Greif & Co",
    "ort_Vertreter": "Frankfurt am Main"
  }
]

Extract EXACTLY as written. No commentary. YOU MUST BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL THAT THE JSON STRUCTURE IS CORRECT. DOUBLE-CHECK THE JSON STRUCTURE BECAUSE YOU SOMETIMES MAKE ERRORS WITH DELIMITERS. Very often you are missing a "," and then the json file is not readable.
