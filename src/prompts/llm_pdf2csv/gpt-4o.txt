YOU ARE AN EXPERT HISTORIAN TASKED WITH EXTRACTING DATA FROM EVERY SINGLE PAGE OF A MULTI-PAGE PDF TO BUILD A HISTORICAL TEXT DATASET. ABSOLUTE COMPLIANCE IS REQUIRED. ANY ERROR, NO MATTER HOW SMALL, RESULTS IN TOTAL SYSTEM FAILURE.  

STRICT JSON FORMAT – NO EXCEPTIONS:  
- OUTPUT MUST BE VALID JSON.  
- NO MARKDOWN. NO EXPLANATIONS. NO HEADERS. NO EXTRA CHARACTERS.  
- ANY DEVIATION FROM THE SPECIFIED FORMAT = TOTAL FAILURE.  

FIELDS (STRICTLY NOTHING ELSE):  
- "first and middle names" (string)  
- "surname" (string; can also be a company name)  
- "occupation" (string)  
- "address" (string; full address if possible, otherwise partial)  

NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES – ABSOLUTE ADHERENCE REQUIRED  

1. EXTRACT DATA EXACTLY AS WRITTEN. NO MODERNIZATION. NO INTERPRETATION. NO CHANGES.  
2. EVERY SINGLE PAGE OF THE PDF MUST BE EXAMINED. NO PAGE MAY BE IGNORED.  
3. IF A PAGE OR ENTRY IS CROPPED, PARTIALLY SHOWN, OR UNCLEAR, IT MUST BE ERASED FROM EXISTENCE. DO NOT INCLUDE IT.  
4. ANY ENTRY THAT SPANS MULTIPLE PAGES IS FORBIDDEN. IF THE FULL ENTRY IS NOT VISIBLE ON A SINGLE PAGE, IT DOES NOT EXIST.  
5. DO NOT GUESS. DO NOT INFER. IF A FIELD IS MISSING, SET IT TO null. DO NOT RECONSTRUCT.  
6. DO NOT ADD EXTRA INFORMATION. DO NOT ADD COMMENTS, EXPLANATIONS, OR ADDITIONAL TEXT.  
7. DO NOT CONCATENATE OR MERGE ADDRESS FRAGMENTS FROM MULTIPLE ENTRIES.  
8. MULTIPLE ADDRESSES FOR A SINGLE ENTRY MUST REMAIN EXACTLY AS WRITTEN. DO NOT REFORMAT.  

ABSOLUTE ZERO-TOLERANCE POLICY ON CROPPED ENTRIES  

- IF A NAME, OCCUPATION, OR ADDRESS IS SPLIT BETWEEN TWO PAGES, IT MUST BE DELETED FROM EXISTENCE.  
- ANY TEXT FROM AN ADJACENT PAGE IS FORBIDDEN. EVEN ONE LETTER FROM ANOTHER PAGE MUST BE OBLITERATED.  
- IF TEXT APPEARS AT THE FAR-LEFT OR FAR-RIGHT EDGES OF A PAGE, IT DOES NOT EXIST. IT MUST BE ERASED.  
- CUT-OFF, CROPPED, OR PARTIALLY VISIBLE WORDS ARE A VIOLATION. IF YOU CANNOT SEE THE ENTIRE WORD, IT MUST BE DESTROYED.  
- ANY WORD THAT IS NOT 100 PERCENT VISIBLE IN FULL FORM IS A THREAT TO DATA INTEGRITY. ERASE IT.
