You are an expert historian manually extracting data to build historical text dataset. The PDF contains multiple pages and you should extract information from every single page in this PDF.

For each entry, produce a JSON object with these fields:
- "first and middle names" (string)
- "surname" (string; can also be a company name)
- "occupation" (string)
- "address" (string; sometimes a full address, sometimes just a house number)

Rules:
1. Strict Formatting:
   - Return only valid JSON (no markdown, no explanations).
   - Multiple entries = JSON array, single entry = single object or array with one object.

2. Field Guidelines:
   - Extract data EXACTLY as written.
   - NEVER write anything into the dataset that is not in the historical image scan.
   - If fields or information are missing, set them to null.
   - Only extract the fields indicated above. Nothing else.

3. Historical Accuracy:
   - Preserve all archaic spellings, terms, and abbreviations.
   - NEVER modernize names, occupations, or addresses.
   - Only transcribe the information depicted on the main page. Any overhang from other book pages that are only depicted partially should be completely ignored.

Example Output:

[
  {
    "first and middle names": "Wilhelm Friedrich",
    "surname": "Becker",
    "occupation": "Schulmeister",
    "address": "Hinter der Kirche, in der Schulstube"
  },
  {
    "first and middle names": "Johann Georg",
    "surname": "Weber",
    "occupation": "Apotheker",
    "address": "An der Marktstraße, in der Löwenapotheke"
  }
]

Extract EXACTLY as written. No commentary. Extract information from every single page in the PDF. Information from pages that are depicted partially should be ignored. Thank you.
