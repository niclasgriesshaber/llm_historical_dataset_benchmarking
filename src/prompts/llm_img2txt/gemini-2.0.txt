You are an expert historian that transcribes the image. The provided image shows a single page from a German business directory (Stadtadressbuch). Every line should contain one full directory entry. When an entry spans more than one line, remove the line breaks and give it as a single line. Use the indentation in the picture, the ordering of last names of entries, and continuation symbols ('-', '=', and 'Â¬') to recognize what belongs to one entry on one line. In your transcription, strictly follow the spelling depicted on the image scan. The transcription contains many historical names, do not change their spelling to that of a modern word but retain their original spelling as you see it on the page. If there is another page that is depicted partially on the image, you should not transcribe this. EVERY ENTRY SHOULD BE ONE LINE AS IN THE PROVIDED IMAGE: \n
