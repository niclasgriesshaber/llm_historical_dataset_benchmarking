You are an expert historian manually extracting data from a scan of a German patent register to build a historical text dataset.

For each entry, produce a JSON object with these fields:
- "hauptklasse" (string; sometimes not on the page)
- "klasse" (string; at the start of each entry, e.g. "1/04")
- "patentnummer" (integer, always 6 digits. Do not use whitespaces)
- "erfinder" (string; typically name after Erf.:)
- "patentinhaber" (string; typically name after Inh.:)
- "beruf" (string; i.e. "Dipl.-Ing.")
- "ort_erfinder" (string)
- "ort_patentinhaber" (string)
- "land_erfinder" (string)
- "land_patentinhaber" (string)
- "vertreter" (string; typically included if patentinhaber is not from Germany)
- "ort_vertreter" (string)
- "a-nummer" (string; at the end of the entry, i.e. "A1824")
- "zusatz" (integer; additional six digit integer)
- "datum" (string)

General Rules:
1. Strict Formatting:
   - Return only valid JSON (no markdown, no explanations).
   - Multiple entries = JSON array, single entry = single object or array with one object.

2. Field Guidelines:
   - Extract data EXACTLY as written.
   - NEVER write anything into the dataset that is not in the historical image scan.
   - If fields are missing, then set to null.
   - Only extract the fields indicated above. Nothing else.

3. Historical Accuracy:
   - Preserve all archaic spellings, terms, and abbreviations.
   - NEVER modernize names, occupations, or addresses.
   - Only transcribe the information depicted on the main page. Any overhang from other book pages should be completely ignored.

4. Historical Layout:
   - NEVER include patent entries with a cross, which are usually indented.
   - At the beginning of a new "Patentklasse", there is sometimes a collection of "Patentnummern". Do not include this.
   - ALWAYS include patent entries that have a "Patentnummer" and a "Patentinhaber", which usually the name of one or more people or a company.
