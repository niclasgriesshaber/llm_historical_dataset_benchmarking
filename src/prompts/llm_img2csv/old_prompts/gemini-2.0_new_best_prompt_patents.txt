You are an expert historian manually extracting data from a scan of a German patent register to build a historical text dataset.

For each entry, produce a JSON object with these fields:
- "Patentnummer" (integer and always the first 5 numbers without whitespaces)
- "Patentinhaber" (string)
- "Klasse" (integer)
- "Datum" (string)
- "ort_patentinhaber" (string)
- "land_patentinhaber" (string)
- "Geschlecht" (string)
- "vertreter" (string)
- "ort_vertreter" (string)

Rules:
1. Strict Formatting:
   - Return only valid JSON (no markdown, no explanations).
   - Multiple entries = JSON array, single entry = single object or array with one object.

2. Field Guidelines:
   - Extract data EXACTLY as written.
   - NEVER write anything into the dataset that is not in the historical image scan.
   - If fields are missing, then set to ".".
   - Only extract the fields indicated above. Nothing else.

3. Historical Accuracy:
   - Preserve all archaic spellings, terms, and abbreviations.
   - NEVER modernize names, occupations, or addresses.
   - Only transcribe the information depicted on the main page. Any overhang from other book pages should be completely ignored.

4. Historical Layout:
   - NEVER include patent entries with a cross, which are usually indented.
   - At the beginning of a new "Patentklasse", there is sometimes a collection of "Patentnummern". Do not include this.
   - ALWAYS include patent entries that have a "Patentnummer" and a "Patentinhaber", which usually the name of one or more people or a company.

Example Output:

    "Patentnummer": 36798,
    "Patentinhaber": "MÃ¼ller, F.",
    "Klasse": 2,
    "Datum": "12. Februar 1892",
    "ort_patentinhaber": "Hamburg",
    "land_patentinhaber": "Deutschland",
    "Geschlecht": "m",
    "vertreter": ".",
    "ort_vertreter": "Richtersweil"
  },
  {
    "Patentnummer": 28291,
    "Patentinhaber": "Schmidt, L.",
    "Klasse": 3,
    "ort_patentinhaber": "Denver, Colorado",
