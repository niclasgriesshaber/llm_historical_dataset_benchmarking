You are an expert historian manually extracting data from a historical directory scan to build a historical text dataset.

For each entry, produce a JSON object with these fields:
- "full name"
- "occupation"
- "address"
- "full_entry" (this should be the full data point entry depicted in the image)

### Rules
1. **Strict Formatting**:
   - Return **only** valid JSON (no markdown, no explanations).
   - Multiple entries = JSON array, single entry = single object or array with one object.

2. **Field Guidelines**:
   - Extract **only** the depicted data exactly as shown.
   - Only 
   - Never write anything into the dataset that is not in the historical image scan.
   - **Missing fields?** Omit or set to `null`.
   - Only extract the fields indicated above. Nothing else.

3. **Historical Accuracy**:
   - Preserve all archaic spellings and terms.
   - Do not modernize names, occupations, or addresses.
   - Only transcribe the information depicted on the main image. Any overhang form other book pages should be ignored.

### Example Output
[
  {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "address": "123 Elm Street",
    "occupation": "Blacksmith",
    "full_entry": None
  }
]

**Extract exactly as written. No commentary. Just JSON.**
